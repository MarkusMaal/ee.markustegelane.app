# Official MarkusTegelane Android app

This new project is completely different from the legacy app, which doesn't even run on modern Android versions.

The end goal of this project is to offer you an app that can do the following:

* View various pages and articles on MarkusTegelane website
* Browse and download my videos and wallpapers
* Get notifications for new uploads, posts, etc (optional feature for the user)

However, this app is currently in really early development stages, so most of these features currently don't exist or are only partially implemented.

No signed binary is available for download, so you'll have to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to compile and install this pre-release version of the app.
